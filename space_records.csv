From the earliest stars to modern planetary systems, fusion converts hydrogen into heavier elements, forging the matter that makes up worlds, atmospheres, and living organisms. The Sun's steady fusion output governs Earth's climate and underlies all biological and technological energy flows, from photosynthesis to fossil fuels.",Spaceflight News API,spaceflight_news,2025-12-19 01:51:15+00:00,policy_or_corporate,True,False,,,34892,2025-12-25 20:55:25.241981
